 About asking help:
 Ask on correct channels. First do some research and testing before asking, because you're asking people more than what you think.
 Make the question in a single message, containing your purpose, the issue, relevant information and the code you tried.

 Remember to write your code in codeblocks like this:  
\`\`\`language  
Code here...  
\`\`\` 

If you do not follow the above rules, you will get muted, kicked, or banned.

Note: We reserve the permission to update rules without notice. Big updates will be announced on ‚Å†üì¢‚îÉannouncements
