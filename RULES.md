# Rules
## 1. Be Respectful
This means no mean, rude, or harassing comments. This also includes random and/or unnecessary pings. Treat others the way you want to be treated.
## 2. Keep Inappropriate Language to a Minimum.
Use of profanity should be kept to a reasonable minimum. Derogatory language towards any user is prohibited. Swearing is permitted in casual channels only, while the official help and code channels should be kept free of any profane language.
## 3. No Spam or Self-Promotion/Advertising
Spam is allowed as long as it is contained to ‚Å†#ü§ê‚îÉspam. Advertisment of any kind is not allowed. If you are wanting to promote your own services, you can do so in ‚Å†#üîç‚îÉlooking-for-programmer.
## 4. No Inappropriate Content
This includes NSFW content, gore, or anything else that may be considered inappropriate. This also includes links to any of the above or content in usernames and profile pictures.
You will be giving a verbal warning (via DMs) and will have 72 hours to change it. Failure to do so will result in a permanent ban.
## 5. Don‚Äôt Share Illegal or Pirated Content
Do not share links to illegal or pirated content, such as copyrighted material or stolen software. This is against the Discord Terms of Service and can result in a ban from the server.
## 6. No sharing or distributing viruses or malicious software
Sharing or distributing viruses or malicious software can harm the server and its members, and is therefore strictly prohibited.
This also includes software that is annoying and/or inconvenient. For example, a batch script that shuts off the computer will be considered malicious because of the risk of possible data loss.
## 7. Do not impersonate other users, staff members, or any other individuals or organizations.
This includes using similar usernames, profile pictures, or display names along with claiming to be a staff member or representative of the server or any other organization.
## 8. No Political or Sensitive Content
This includes topics such as gun laws, religion, government debates, and sensitive events. Whether something is considered political or sensitive is up to the discretion of the staff team.
## 9. Alt Accounts Must Be Verified
If you have an alt account, you must verify it with a staff member. If you do not verify your alt account, it will be banned.
## 10. Rule Evasion Equals Breaking Rules
Any attempt to evade a rule through technicalities and exploitation will count as breaking a rule and you will be punished as such.
## 11. Abide by Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
These rules are an extension of Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

# About asking for help
 Ask on correct channels. First do some research and testing before asking, because you're asking people more than what you think. Make the question in a single message, containing your purpose, the issue, relevant information and the code you tried.

 Remember to write your code in codeblocks like this:  
\`\`\`language  
Code here...  
\`\`\` 

If you do not follow the above rules, you will get muted, kicked, or banned.

Note: We reserve the permission to update rules without notice. Big updates will be announced on ‚Å†#üì¢‚îÉannouncements
